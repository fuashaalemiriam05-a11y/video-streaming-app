# Progress Tracker

## Completed
- Scaffolding for a monorepo with client and server apps
- Frontend feature folders for auth, catalog, player, creator-studio, billing, moderation
- Backend MVC-style module folders under server/src/modules
- Prisma schema, Redis/BullMQ queue setup, Docker Compose, and CI workflow

## Open Questions
- Confirm whether the platform should use Prisma Client generation during initial setup or defer until database is available.
- Confirm the preferred S3-compatible storage provider and credential flow for uploads.
- Confirm whether shadcn/ui should be installed directly or kept as a scaffold placeholder at this stage.
- Confirm whether role-based auth and real session management should be implemented in the first iteration or left as placeholder middleware.
